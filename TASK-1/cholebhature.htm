<h2>Chole Bhature â€“ Chole Bhature is a very popular dish when eating out. It is a mini meal generally served with pickle and tomato onion salad. In restaurants, you get this huge balloon like bhaturas that are simply hard to resist.<br> Though Bhatura is deep fried food its dough is fermented so we do not mind eating it.</h2>
