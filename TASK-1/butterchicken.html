<h2>Butter chicken, traditionally known as Murgh makhani, (pronounced [mʊrg ˈmək. kʰə.ni]) is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture.<br> In addition sometimes the cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. </h2>
